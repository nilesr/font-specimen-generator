# Font displayer

Just a script to help me organize my fonts and find the ones I'm looking for. Should generate font specimens for any .otf or .ttf font. 

Directory is hardcoded so just change it in `test.py`

Some example output (not all of it because I have more than 1000 fonts) is in the `example` folder
